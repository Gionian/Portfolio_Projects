Portfolio Project: COVID-19 Analysis using SQL

This project involves analyzing COVID-19 data from two different datasets - Covid_Death and Covid_Vaccination. These datasets were imported to a Microsoft SQL Server instance and queried using SQL to obtain insights into the spread and impact of COVID-19 on different countries and continents.

Project Overview
The main objective of this project is to analyze COVID-19 data to obtain insights into the spread and impact of the virus on different countries and continents. To achieve this objective, two datasets were used - Covid_Death and Covid_Vaccination. The Covid_Death dataset contains information about the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in different countries, while the Covid_Vaccination dataset contains information about the number of COVID-19 vaccinations administered in different countries.

The following SQL queries were used to extract insights from the datasets:

SELECT statements to retrieve data from the datasets
JOIN statements to combine data from the two datasets
GROUP BY statements to group data by location and continent
ORDER BY statements to sort data by different columns
WITH statements to define common table expressions
CREATE VIEW statement to create a view for data visualization
Insights Obtained
The SQL queries used in this project helped in obtaining the following insights:

Likelihood of dying if you contract COVID-19 in a country
Percentage of population that was infected by COVID-19
Countries with the highest infection rate compared to population
Countries with the highest death count per population
Continents with the highest death count per population
Percentage of population that has received at least one COVID-19 vaccine
Conclusion
This project highlights the importance of analyzing data to obtain insights into the spread and impact of COVID-19. By querying the Covid_Death and Covid_Vaccination datasets using SQL, we were able to obtain valuable insights into the COVID-19 pandemic. These insights can be used to guide policy decisions and public health interventions aimed at mitigating the spread and impact of the virus.
